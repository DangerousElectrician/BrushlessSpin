This is the brushless motor driver code ripped out of BruGi because I needed a quick way to drive a brushless motor.

BrushlessSpin.ino spins the brushless motor.
BLcontroller.h has all the functions for spinning the motor.

All the other *.h files are for making the brushless motor driver functions work.
